      <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: These three front-end development languages are the foundation of web design and are the basic languages you should know. HTML creates the general structure of a website, while CSS works to add additional formatting and stylistic designs.
        The most complex of the three, JavaScript enables you to make a website interactive by implementing things such as keyboard shortcuts.
        SQL and NoSQL: Front-end developers need to be able to interact with permanently stored data such as user profile information. SQL and NoSQL allow you to manage databases and access data through specific queries. 
        Frameworks: Frameworks provide a foundation of features in place like coding libraries, scripting languages, and software that support the maintenance and development of large projects.
        Popular frameworks include React, Angular, Vue.js, and jQuery.
        Testing and debugging: Front-end developers perform unit testing and functional testing to confirm the functionality of a website. 
        Specific frameworks are designed to help you with this process, such as Mocha and Jasmine.
        Responsive design: With people accessing websites from a multitude of different devices, front-end developers need an understanding of responsive design.
        Your code will need to allow websites to adapt to different devices, such as a smartphone, laptop, or tablet.</p>

        The University of Toronto (UToronto or U of T) is a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located on the grounds that surround Queen's Park.
        It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada. Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed its present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises 11 colleges each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs and significant differences in character and history.
        The university maintains three campuses, the oldest of which is St. George, located in downtown Toronto. The other two satellite campuses are located in Scarborough and Mississauga.
        The University of Toronto offers over 700 undergraduate and 200 graduate programs. 
        The university receives the most annual scientific research funding and endowment of any Canadian university. 
        It is also one of two members of the Association of American Universities outside the United States, alongside McGill University. 
        Academically, the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and communication theory,
        known collectively as the Toronto School.
        The university was the birthplace of insulin and stem cell research,
        the first artificial cardiac pacemaker, and the site of the first successful lung transplant and nerve transplant. 
        The university was also home to the first electron microscope, the development of deep learning, neural network, multi-touch technology, the identification of the first black hole Cygnus X-1,
        and the development of the theory of NP-completeness.
        The University of Toronto is the recipient of both the single largest philanthropic gift in Canadian history, a $250 million donation from James and Louise Temerty in 2020, and the largest ever research grant in Canada, a $200 million grant from the Government of Canada in 2023.
        
        The Varsity Blues are the athletic teams that represent the university in intercollegiate league matches, primarily within U Sports, with ties to gridiron football, rowing and ice hockey. The earliest recorded instance of gridiron football occurred at University of Toronto's University College in November 1861.
        The university's Hart House is an early example of the North American student centre, simultaneously serving cultural, intellectual, and recreational interests within its large Gothic-revival complex.
        University of Toronto alumni include five Prime Ministers of Canada (including William Lyon Mackenzie King and Lester B. Pearson), three Governors General of Canada, nine foreign leaders, and 17 justices of the Supreme Court of Canada.
        As of 2019, 12 Nobel laureates, six Turing Award winners, 100 Rhodes Scholars, and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with the university.
